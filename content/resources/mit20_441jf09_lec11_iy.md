description: Lecture notes on methodology for measuring surface ligand density, investigating
  the surfaces of biomaterials, assays of proteins adsorbed on biomaterials surfaces,
  quantitative methods for measuring the ligand density of surfaces, the need for
  a measurement of density of bound ligands in cell-seeded scaffolds, the need for
  a three-dimensional (3D) description of cell-scaffold interactions, choice of microscopy
  method for study of cell-seeded surfaces of biomaterials, and the molecular mechanism
  by which collagen-GAG scaffolds modify cell phenotypes in four cases.
