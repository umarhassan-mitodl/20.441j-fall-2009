description: Lecture presentation on the anatomy and function of a peripheral nerve,
  experimental parameters for study of induced regeneration, synthesis of myelinated
  axons and BM (nerve fibers), evidence of synthesis of an endoneurium, synthesis
  of a nerve trunk (including summary of kinetics of synthesis), and comparative regenerative
  activity of various reactants.
